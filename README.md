# Flutter - Clean Architecture with Bloc pattern

This project was created to understand Clean Architecture using Bloc pattern for the flutter. For clarity, this app uses a public [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Goals :computer:
- Keep code clean
- Keep code testable
- Keep separation of concerns(Presentation-Domain-Data)

## Built With 🛠
- [Flutter BLOC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) - Flutter Widgets that make it easy to implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern. Built to be used with the bloc state management package.
- [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) - Code generator for data classes, unions, and cloning..
- [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - A Dart package that helps to implement value based equality without needing to explicitly override == and hashCode.
- [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) - Simple direct Service Locator that allows to decouple the interface from a concrete implementation and to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App
- [Flutter Secure Storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) - Flutter Secure Storage provides API to store data in secure storage. Keychain is used in iOS, KeyStore based solution is used in Android.
